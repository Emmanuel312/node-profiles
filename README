# How to test?

## Local
Run the command:
```
npm run start
```

You should see that node-config will use both default and __local environment

## Dev
Run the command:
```
export NODE_ENV=dev
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=MY_SECRET_PASSWORD
node index.js
```
You should see that node-config will use both default and dev environment and retrieve the DATABASE_PASSWORD variable exported by OS.
